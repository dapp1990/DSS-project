\subsection{Iteration 1 \& 2: Image Filtering}
A proposed improvement is adding input fields (potentially a tuple <priority, filterType>) in the \textit{FilterReplaceImage} in order to do the configuration using the GUI provided by zaproxy. \textit{ConfigurationReader} now is updated to a new factory class which creates and removes instances of \textit{SimpleImageFilter} according with the final user configuration. The configuration file is no longer need, therefore the coupling in the name classes disappears.

\textit{Configurationreader} could be equipped with a richer parsing mechanism that would have an error margin on the parsed names, for example: case insensitivity and trimming.
\subsection{Iteration 3: Content Filtering}
\subsection{Iteration 4: Content Reporting}
The current implementation does not allow the final user to select the specific image statistic type in the report. Next improvement considers a GUI implementation using the \textit{hook} abstract method provide by \textit{ExtensionAdaptor}. \textit{ImageStatisticsFactory} can be adapted to add those responsibilities: keep tracking the final user image statistic type selections and instantiating/removing the corresponding ImageStatistics classes in runtime.

\subsection{Iteration 5: Refactoring}
\subsubsection{org.parosproxy.paros.core.proxy.ExtensionLoader}
\textit{ExtensionList}should take over more functionality for the encapsulated list and map. This will require some careful redesigning of the classes, other than \textit{ExtensionLoader}, previously accessing the extensions.
