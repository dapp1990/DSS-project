\subsection{Iteration 4: Content Reporting}
The current implementation does not allow the final user to select the specific image statistic type in the report. Next improvement considers a GUI implementation using the \textit{hook} abstract method provide by \textit{ExtensionAdaptor}. This implies the creation of a new \textit{ImageStatisticsMaganer} class which responsibilities will be keeping track the final user image statistic type selections and instantiating/removing the corresponding ImageStatistics classes in runtime. \textit{ExtensionImageReport} will call this manager to get the XML images statistics formats. A new call indirection is created while the image statistics tasks in \textit{ExtensionImageReport} are delegated to \textit{ImageStatisticsMaganer}, hence the responsibilities and cohesion are maintain in expert classes.
